# Jarvis_March_Convex_Hull_API
This is an implemetation and visualization of Jarvis March Convex Hull Algorithm for 2D points.

To run this, you can just open the terminal and run the following command:
  ./script.sh
  
Or if you want to modify the source-code or input:
  1. Open the main.cpp file
  2. You can modify the input by changing the input number in line-10(i.e. fileName1, i have given 9 sample inputs in the "Inputs" directory, you can add your own input file).
  3. You can use different functions available in this API(check doxygen documentation provided by going into "html/index.html") to modify the code.
  4. Then do the following commands
        g++ main.cpp
        ./a.out
        python3 jarvis_visual.py
  5. You can check the resulting output visualization as jarvis.gif in the same directory.
